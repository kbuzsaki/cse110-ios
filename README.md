# Pollr iOS Application

## Dependencies
We are using Cocoa Pods. Make sure you have cocoapods installed on your machine and "pods help" is a working command.
To install pods, "sudo gem install cocoapods" should be enough. If it's not working, there are plenty of resources on [cocoapods.org][www.cocoapods.org].

Once you have pods installed, run "pod install" in the root directory of this repo, where the "Podfile" is located.
